TITTLE: Third one-page project

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, rwd, jQuery, flexbox.

DESCRIPTION: The biggest problem from the beginning of my programming adventure
was centering the text vertically. I could use paddings/margins but for the smaller
devices it didn't look good so I learned about Flexbox. It's not a difficult thing
but the effects are amazing. My problems with centering  the text dissappeared.
There is also a Modal in a separate .css file and scroll effect.
